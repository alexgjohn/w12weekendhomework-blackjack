# w12weekendhomework-blackjack

This blackjack program simulates a blackjack game with several pieces of game logic at play. 

To run the program, simply import the card and player packages, as well as the blackjack class. Next, instantiate as many players as you like, a dealer, a deck and a (game of) blackjack, using the deck and dealer as the instance variable when instantiating the blackjack object. 
You'll next need to add the created players to the game using the blackjack.addPlayer() method. 
Finally, call the blackjack.playGame() method and let the fun unfold!
